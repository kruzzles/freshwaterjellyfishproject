   <h1> PARAGRAPHS </h1>
    <h2> SECTION 1 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The species that I will be 
      focusing on for this project is the freshwater jellyfish. 
      They have existed on earth for up to 600 million years, 
      they became an endangered species in 2002. Humans hunt
      some edible species of jellyfish. Jellyfish is used 
      in dishes like salads and sushi however, 
      scientists have said jellyfish are not a significant 
      item on the seafood menu as they are made up of 95% 
      water and have very little calories. Even though they
      aren't a very good source of calories there are other 
      possible benefits. Some of these benefits are having
      important nutrients like protein and antioxidants.
      Freshwater jellyfish are very sensitive to changes 
      in their environment so human interventions such 
      as pollution, changes in climate and overfishing
      are very harmful to them. The water temperature 
      freshwater jellyfish need to survive is 20-25°C 
      (68-77°F.) Thermal pollution can increase water 
      temperature which is very dangerous to jellyfish.
      Another issue pollution has caused for jellyfish 
      is that it is killing phytoplankton which is one
      of their main prey.
    </p>
    
    <h2> SECTION 2 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is very little biological
      diversity in freshwater jellyfish. This is due to a few 
      factors. The first one is that they have very few
      predators. The second is that freshwater jellyfish 
      almost always reproduce by budding, asexual reproduction 
      makes exact clones which means no variation happens.
      The third is the impacts humans have had on them, 
      they are very quickly losing their habitat
      which is causing less biodiversity. Thermal pollution
      causes more algae to grow and water temperature to 
      increase. When there is too much algae toxins are
      released into the water, the water's oxygen content is
      lowered and the sunlight is blocked. When this happens to 
      an ecosystem the jellyfish are likely to die off as they 
      are sensitive to change.
    </p>

    <h2> SECTION 3 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a medicine called prevagen which uses a 
      protein found in jellyfish called apoaequorin. 
      Prevagen is used to help with memory loss and in 
      2015 Quincy Bioscience (the company that made
      prevagen) said prevagen is the "best-selling 
      branded memory suppliment." Unfortunately,
      there are issues with prevagen. The food and 
      drug administration (FDA) has questioned its
      safety and the makers of Prevagen were sued 
      by the FTC (federal trade commission) and the
      New York Attorney General over false claims
      about the product. Prevagen is made without 
      harming jellyfish at all which also means it 
      has little impact on the environment and doesn't
      affect the jellyfish.
    </p>

    <h2> SECTION 4 </h2>
    <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans should use 
      biotechnology on jellyfish. There is a lot of 
      potential for new medicines and antibiotics to be 
      created from jellyfish. Prevagen has proved that 
      jellyfish can certainly be used to create helpful
      products. People should have more involvement in 
      biodiversity in jellyfish, it is clear having 
      no variation has been an issue to freshwater 
      jellyfish. If humans would help freshwater jellyfish
      be more diverse they would be less sensitive to 
      changes in their environment. There have been many
      other successes in biotechnology used for jellyfish. 
      Jellyfish venom is being tested for treating diseases.
      The reason they are testing jellyfish venom is because 
      it can destroy cells, this means it could slow
      the growth of cells that have a disease. This may seem
      outrageous but in a lab trial, jellyfish venom was able 
      to stop the growth of cancer cells. It slowed down the 
      growth of certain cancer cells after exposure to venom
      for 48 hours. The study revealed that the venom affected
      the development of lung and liver cancer cells. However,
      these are only tests are there is still a long way to
      go before we can use jellyfish to treat 
      disease. So far there is little proof that we can 
      treat disease with jellyfish.
